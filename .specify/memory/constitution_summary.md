# Constitution v1.0.0 - Summary

**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Type**: Initial Constitution

## Overview

This constitution establishes foundational principles for the Word Game Flutter/Dart project, focusing on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements aligned with TDD and Clean Architecture.

## 7 Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable) 🔴🟢🔄

- **TDD is mandatory** - tests written before implementation
- Strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- ≥80% test coverage required
- Test categories: Unit, Widget, Integration, Contract
- Randomized test ordering enforced

### II. Clean Architecture Layers 🏗️

- Three-layer structure: Domain → Data → Presentation
- Domain layer framework-independent (no Flutter imports)
- Repository pattern with interfaces in domain, implementations in data
- Use cases are single-responsibility
- Dependency injection via GetIt

### III. Code Quality Standards ✨

- Strict linting enforced (very_good_analysis)
- Zero warnings/errors allowed
- 80-character line limits
- Comprehensive documentation (doc comments on public APIs)
- Maximum 300 lines per file

### IV. Performance Requirements ⚡

- 60 fps UI requirement
- <3 second cold start
- Heavy computations on isolates
- Lazy loading for large lists
- Profile mode testing mandatory

### V. User Experience Consistency 🎨

- Material Design 3 theming
- l10n for all user-facing text
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Light and dark theme support
- User-friendly error handling

### VI. Type Safety & Null Safety 🛡️

- Sound null safety (100%)
- Explicit type annotations on public APIs
- Immutability via Freezed
- Minimal use of `!` operator

### VII. Immutability & State Management 🔄

- BLoC pattern for all state management
- Immutable state classes (Freezed)
- Predictable data flow
- Independent BLoC testing

## Additional Sections

### Development Standards

- Flutter 3.35.0+, Dart 3.9.0+
- Conventional Commits format
- Three flavors: development, staging, production
- Required packages: bloc, flutter_bloc, get_it, freezed, mocktail

### Quality Gates (6 Gates)

1. **Test Gate**: All tests pass, ≥80% coverage
2. **Lint Gate**: Zero warnings/errors
3. **Architecture Gate**: Clean Architecture respected
4. **Performance Gate**: No frame drops, no memory leaks
5. **UX Gate**: l10n, themes, accessibility
6. **Documentation Gate**: Public APIs documented

### Governance

- Constitution supersedes all practices
- Semantic versioning for amendments
- Compliance verified in code reviews
- Living document with formal amendment process

## Template Alignment

### ✅ Updated Templates

1. **plan-template.md**

   - Added concrete Constitution Check section with 7 principle gates
   - Updated Technical Context examples for Flutter/Dart
   - Modified source structure to reflect Clean Architecture
   - Updated version reference to v1.0.0

2. **tasks-template.md**

   - Updated task examples for Flutter/Dart patterns
   - Reflected Clean Architecture layers (domain/data/presentation)
   - Added BLoC/Cubit, Freezed, and code generation tasks
   - Enhanced task generation rules for Clean Architecture

3. **spec-template.md**
   - Added Non-Functional Requirements section
   - Included performance, UX, and quality NFRs
   - Aligned with constitution principles

### ⚠️ Future Considerations

- Consider creating Flutter-specific quickstart template
- May add more specific widget testing guidelines
- Could expand on CI/CD pipeline requirements

```

## Usage

Developers should:

1. Review constitution before starting new features
2. Use Constitution Check in plan-template.md for all features
3. Ensure all quality gates pass before PR submission
4. Reference constitution during code reviews
5. Propose amendments through formal process when needed

## Key Differentiators

This constitution is specifically tailored for:

- **Flutter 3.35.5** and **Dart 3.9.2**
- **TDD methodology** (non-negotiable)
- **Clean Architecture** (strict layer boundaries)
- **Mobile-first** development (performance, UX, accessibility)
- **BLoC pattern** for state management
- **Freezed** for immutability

Unlike generic constitutions, this provides concrete, actionable guidance specific to Flutter/Dart mobile development with measurable quality gates.
